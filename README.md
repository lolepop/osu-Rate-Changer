![Preview image](images/preview.jpg)

A song rate changer for osu! that doesn't rely on direct edits to audio files.

[See the program in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LZtB8Q1bYE)

## Features
  - External client to adjust in-game speed
  - Custom rates
  - Supports all game modes
  - Set preset rates and save them
  - Stunning WinForms UI design

## How to use

1. Make sure the game is started and **make sure you are signed out**
2. Click *inject*
3. Start any song
4. Now you can adjust the rate you want and click the *Update Speed* button
5. **Turn on any speed modifier mod (DT or HT)** (will not work if you skip this step)
6. You can start the song normally with the mod on

### Additional steps for Mania
If you play the Mania mode with the "Scale osu!mania scroll speed with BPM" option, you may want to fix the scroll speed while using this program.

7. Instead of starting any map, make sure to start one in Mania mode
8. Check "Bpm scaling fix" and wait until the checkbox is no longer greyed out

## Limitations
  - The program uses DLL injection to internally change the game's memory and your antivirus may flag it as a result.
  - Basically timewarp lmao (can't play logged in)

## Main advantages (Over editing audio files and maps)
  - AR scales properly (manually editing the map will limit you to a maximum of AR 10)
  - Removes the need to modify the map
  - No gigantic song folders for slightly different rates
  - No need to wait for the year 2140 when lazer gets released

## Disclaimer
This program is not designed as a cheat should not be used as such. If you use it and get banned, that's your fault.
